# Intelligent Workflows & Agent Selection

## Overview

Gemini Code Flow implements an intelligent workflow selection system that prevents agent proliferation by dynamically choosing the appropriate development approach based on project complexity. Instead of spawning all 29 available agents for every project, the system analyzes your requirements and selects only the essential agents needed, with the ability to delegate to specialists as required.

## Core Principles

### üß† Smart Agent Selection
- **Analyze First**: The orchestrator examines project requirements to determine complexity
- **Select Appropriately**: Choose minimal, rapid, standard, or comprehensive workflows
- **Delegate Dynamically**: Core agents spawn specialists only when actually needed
- **Scale Naturally**: Complexity matches project requirements

### ‚ö° Efficiency Over Exhaustiveness
- Simple projects use 1-2 agents (calculator, todo app)
- Normal projects use 5-6 core agents (web apps, APIs)
- Complex projects use 8-12 agents (enterprise systems)
- All 29 agents available via delegation when needed

## Workflow Types

### üöÄ Minimal Workflow
**When Selected**: Simple, learning, or demo projects
```
Keywords: simple, basic, calculator, todo, prototype, demo, example, tutorial, learning, practice, quick
```

**Agent Flow**:
```
Orchestrator ‚Üí Coder
```

**Use Cases**:
- Simple calculators or tools
- Learning exercises
- Quick demos
- Basic prototypes
- Single-feature applications

**Example**: "Build a simple calculator app"

### ‚ö° Rapid Workflow  
**When Selected**: MVP development and rapid prototyping
```
Keywords: quick, prototype, poc, mvp, demo, rapid, fast
```

**Agent Flow**:
```
Orchestrator ‚Üí Architect ‚Üí Coder
```

**Use Cases**:
- Proof of concepts
- MVP development
- Rapid prototyping
- Demo applications
- Time-constrained projects

**Example**: "Create a quick prototype for a social media app"

### üèóÔ∏è Standard Workflow (Default)
**When Selected**: Most normal development projects
```
Keywords: app, application, website, api, dashboard, platform (moderate complexity)
```

**Agent Flow**:
```
Orchestrator ‚Üí Ask ‚Üí Architect ‚Üí Coder ‚Üí Tester ‚Üí Documentation
```

**Use Cases**:
- Web applications
- Mobile apps
- REST APIs
- Dashboards
- Standard business applications

**Example**: "Build a task management web application"

### üè¢ Comprehensive Workflow
**When Selected**: Enterprise and complex systems
```
Keywords: enterprise, microservices, distributed, scalable, cloud-native, multi-tenant, 
high availability, load balancing, kubernetes, compliance, audit, enterprise-grade, production-ready
```

**Agent Flow**:
```
Orchestrator ‚Üí Product ‚Üí Research ‚Üí Architect ‚Üí Cloud ‚Üí Security ‚Üí Coder ‚Üí QA ‚Üí SRE
```

**Use Cases**:
- Enterprise systems
- Microservices architectures
- Cloud-native applications
- Compliance-required systems
- High-scale platforms

**Example**: "Design an enterprise data analytics platform with microservices"

## Intelligence Algorithm

### Complexity Scoring System

The system analyzes both the user's task description and the orchestrator's initial analysis to score project complexity:

```typescript
// Enterprise Indicators (Score +2 each)
"enterprise", "microservices", "distributed", "scalable", "cloud-native", 
"multi-tenant", "high availability", "compliance", "audit"

// Complexity Indicators (Score +1 each)  
"api", "database", "authentication", "real-time", "integration", 
"backend", "frontend", "mobile", "security", "performance"

// Simplicity Indicators (Score -1 each)
"simple", "basic", "calculator", "todo", "prototype", "demo", 
"example", "tutorial", "learning", "practice"
```

### Decision Logic

```typescript
if (simplicityScore > 0 && complexityScore <= 1) {
    return MINIMAL_WORKFLOW;
} else if (enterpriseScore >= 2 || complexityScore >= 4) {
    return COMPREHENSIVE_WORKFLOW;
} else if (complexityScore >= 1 || taskLength > 200) {
    return STANDARD_WORKFLOW;
} else {
    return RAPID_WORKFLOW;
}
```

## Dynamic Delegation System

### Agent-to-Agent Delegation

Core agents can dynamically spawn specialists using delegation syntax in their outputs:

```
DELEGATE_TO: [agent_mode] - [specific task description]
REQUEST_AGENT: [agent_mode] - [request for additional work]
NEEDS_REVIEW: [agent_mode] - [request for review/feedback]  
ITERATE_WITH: [agent_mode] - [request for iterative improvement]
```

### Delegation Examples

**Architect delegating to specialists**:
```
DELEGATE_TO: cloud - Design Kubernetes deployment strategy
DELEGATE_TO: api - Create REST API specification for microservices
REQUEST_AGENT: security - Review authentication architecture
```

**Coder requesting assistance**:
```
NEEDS_REVIEW: performance - Optimize database query performance
DELEGATE_TO: mobile - Implement responsive design components
ITERATE_WITH: designer - Refine user interface based on feedback
```

## Parallel Execution Intelligence

### Agent Categories for Parallel Processing

**Independent Agents** (Can run simultaneously):
- Documentation, Tutorial, Security, Monitor, QA, Reviewer, Research, UX, Performance, Release, API

**Conflict Groups** (Cannot run together):
- Coder ‚Üî Integrator (code modification conflicts)
- Architect ‚Üî Designer (coordination needed)
- Cloud ‚Üî DevOps (infrastructure overlap)
- Performance ‚Üî Optimizer (optimization conflicts)

**Sequential Agents** (Must run alone):
- Orchestrator (coordinates everything)

### Dependency Management

**Critical Dependencies** (Must be sequential):
```typescript
coder: ["architect", "specification"]
integrator: ["coder"]  
tester: ["coder", "integrator"]
mobile: ["designer", "api"]
cloud: ["architect"]
sre: ["devops", "monitor"]
```

**Soft Dependencies** (Can be parallelized):
- Documentation can run parallel with implementation
- Security analysis can run parallel with development
- Research can run parallel with specification

## Configuration

### Workflow Configuration

```json
{
  "defaultWorkflow": {
    "enabled": true,
    "description": "Intelligent selective workflow - core agents with dynamic delegation",
    "tasks": [...]
  },
  "alternativeWorkflows": {
    "minimal": { "name": "Essential-Only Development", ... },
    "rapid": { "name": "Rapid Prototyping", ... },
    "comprehensive": { "name": "Enterprise-Grade Development", ... }
  }
}
```

### Execution Settings

```json
{
  "execution": {
    "parallelExecution": true,
    "maxParallelAgents": 12,
    "parallelizableAgents": ["documentation", "tutorial", "security", ...],
    "sequentialAgents": ["orchestrator"],
    "conflictGroups": [["coder", "integrator"], ["architect", "designer"]],
    "parallelOptimization": true
  }
}
```

## Best Practices

### Project Description Guidelines

**For Simple Projects**:
```bash
# Use simple, clear language
gemini-flow start --task "Build a basic calculator app"
gemini-flow start --task "Create a simple todo list application"
```

**For Standard Projects**:
```bash
# Describe functionality and basic requirements
gemini-flow start --task "Build a task management web app with user authentication"
gemini-flow start --task "Create a REST API for a blog platform with comments"
```

**For Enterprise Projects**:
```bash
# Include scale, architecture, and enterprise requirements
gemini-flow start --task "Design a scalable microservices platform for enterprise data analytics with cloud-native deployment"
gemini-flow start --task "Build a distributed e-commerce system with high availability and compliance requirements"
```

### Delegation Best Practices

**Agent Authors Should**:
- Use delegation sparingly and only when specialized expertise is needed
- Provide clear, specific task descriptions for delegated work
- Consider whether the task can be handled without delegation
- Use appropriate delegation types (DELEGATE_TO vs REQUEST_AGENT vs NEEDS_REVIEW)

**Avoid Over-Delegation**:
```
‚ùå DELEGATE_TO: coder - Write a simple function
‚úÖ [Just write the function directly]

‚ùå REQUEST_AGENT: tester - Test this basic validation
‚úÖ [Include basic tests in your implementation]

‚úÖ DELEGATE_TO: performance - Optimize high-traffic database queries
‚úÖ REQUEST_AGENT: security - Review authentication implementation
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Too Many Agents Spawned**:
- Check if project description includes enterprise keywords unnecessarily
- Agents may be over-delegating - review delegation patterns
- Consider using minimal or rapid workflow explicitly

**Too Few Agents**:
- Project may be classified as too simple
- Add complexity indicators to task description
- Agents can still delegate to specialists as needed

**Workflow Selection Issues**:
- Review keyword analysis in orchestrator output
- Check alternative workflow configurations
- Verify task description clarity and detail level

### Debug Information

Enable debug logging to see workflow selection:
```bash
LOG_LEVEL=debug gemini-flow start --task "Your project"
```

Output includes:
- Complexity scoring details
- Workflow selection rationale  
- Agent delegation decisions
