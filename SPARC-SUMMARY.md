# Gemini Code Flow - SPARC Project Summary

## Project Overview
Successfully created the foundation for Gemini Code Flow, an adaptation of ruvnet's Claude Code Flow for Google's Gemini CLI platform.

## Completed Components

### 1. Project Structure ✓
- Created organized directory structure following SPARC methodology
- Set up TypeScript configuration with strict typing
- Established clear separation of concerns (core, agents, modes, utils)

### 2. Documentation ✓
- **CLAUDE.md**: Project context and goals
- **PRD.md**: Comprehensive product requirements
- **README.md**: User-facing documentation with full attribution
- **LICENSE**: MIT license with proper attribution to ruvnet

### 3. Core Architecture ✓
- **GeminiClient**: Gemini API integration with multimodal support
- **Orchestrator**: Multi-agent task coordination system
- **Type System**: Strong TypeScript interfaces for all components
- **CLI Interface**: Command-line tool with SPARC commands

### 4. Key Features Implemented
- Multi-agent orchestration (up to 10 parallel agents)
- 17 SPARC development modes defined
- Multimodal input support (images, PDFs)
- Streaming response capability
- Event-driven architecture
- Temperature control per agent mode

## Attribution
Full credit and attribution given to ruvnet throughout:
- License file includes original copyright
- README prominently features attribution
- Code comments reference original project
- Documentation acknowledges adaptation source

## Next Steps
The following components need implementation to complete the project:

1. **Memory Manager**: Persistent storage for agent knowledge
2. **Task Queue**: Priority-based task scheduling
3. **SPARC Mode Implementations**: Individual mode handlers
4. **Command Implementations**: Init, Agent, and Sparc commands
5. **Utils and Helpers**: Logger, config loader, etc.

## Installation Path
```bash
# Future users will be able to:
npm install -g gemini-code-flow
gemini-flow init --sparc
gemini-flow sparc architect "Design my system"
```

## Technical Decisions
1. Used Google's official @google/generative-ai package
2. Maintained event-driven architecture from original
3. Preserved SPARC methodology and mode structure
4. Added Gemini-specific enhancements (multimodal, large context)

## Project Status
Foundation is complete with core architecture in place. The project structure allows for easy extension and follows the original Claude Code Flow patterns while adapting for Gemini's unique capabilities.
