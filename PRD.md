# Product Requirements Document: Gemini Code Flow

## Executive Summary
Gemini Code Flow is an advanced AI-powered development orchestration platform that adapts RuV's Claude Code Flow for Google's Gemini CLI. It enables developers to leverage multiple AI agents working in parallel to write, test, and optimize code using the SPARC methodology.

## Problem Statement
While Claude Code Flow provides excellent multi-agent orchestration for Claude CLI users, Gemini CLI users lack a similar tool that can:
- Orchestrate multiple AI agents for complex development tasks
- Provide specialized development modes (architecture, coding, testing, etc.)
- Maintain persistent memory across sessions
- Enable systematic development through SPARC methodology

## Solution Overview
Gemini Code Flow will provide:
1. Multi-agent orchestration system adapted for Gemini CLI
2. 17 specialized SPARC development modes
3. Persistent memory bank for knowledge sharing
4. Seamless integration with Gemini's multimodal capabilities
5. Enterprise-ready features for production use

## Core Features

### 1. Multi-Agent Orchestration
- Support for up to 10 parallel Gemini agents
- Intelligent task distribution and coordination
- Shared memory bank for inter-agent communication
- Resource management and optimization

### 2. SPARC Development Modes
Adapt all 17 modes from Claude Code Flow:
- 🏗️ Architect - System design using Gemini's large context
- 🧠 Auto-Coder - Clean implementation with Gemini's code generation
- 🧪 Tester (TDD) - Test-driven development
- 🪲 Debugger - Troubleshooting with multimodal analysis
- 🛡️ Security Reviewer - Security audits
- 📚 Documentation Writer - Markdown documentation
- 🔗 System Integrator - Component integration
- 📈 Deployment Monitor - Post-launch monitoring
- 🧹 Optimizer - Performance optimization
- ❓ Ask - Task formulation guide
- 🚀 DevOps - Deployment and infrastructure
- 📘 SPARC Tutorial - Onboarding
- 🔐 Database Admin - Database management
- 📋 Specification Writer - Requirements and pseudocode
- ♾️ MCP Integration - External service connections
- ⚡️ SPARC Orchestrator - Complex workflows
- 🎨 Designer - UI/UX with multimodal capabilities

### 3. Gemini-Specific Enhancements
- Leverage 1M token context window for large codebases
- Multimodal input support (PDFs, sketches, images)
- Google Search grounding for real-time information
- Integration with Gemini's MCP server architecture

### 4. Installation & Usage
```bash
# Install Gemini CLI first
npm install -g @google/gemini-cli

# Install Gemini Code Flow
npm install -g gemini-code-flow

# Initialize project
gemini-flow init --sparc

# Start orchestrator
gemini-flow sparc "build and test my project"
```

## Technical Requirements

### Architecture
- Modular design allowing easy extension
- Event-driven communication between agents
- Persistent storage using JSON/SQLite
- RESTful API for external integrations

### Performance
- Support 10 concurrent agents
- Response time < 2 seconds for agent coordination
- Memory usage < 2GB for typical projects
- Cross-platform compatibility (Windows, Mac, Linux)

### Security
- API key management
- Secure agent communication
- Audit logging
- Rate limiting compliance

## Success Metrics
1. Feature parity with Claude Code Flow core functionality
2. < 5 minute setup time for new users
3. 90% success rate for SPARC mode executions
4. Positive developer feedback and adoption

## Timeline
- Week 1-2: Core architecture and Gemini integration
- Week 3-4: SPARC mode implementations
- Week 5: Testing and refinement
- Week 6: Documentation and release

## Risks & Mitigation
1. **API Differences**: Carefully map Claude API patterns to Gemini equivalents
2. **Rate Limits**: Implement intelligent queuing and batching
3. **Context Management**: Optimize for Gemini's context window
4. **Adoption**: Clear documentation and migration guides
