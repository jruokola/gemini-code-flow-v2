## Project Goals
1. Port Claude Code Flow's SPARC methodology to Gemini CLI
2. Adapt the multi-agent orchestration system for Gemini's architecture
3. Maintain feature parity where possible while leveraging Gemini's unique capabilities
4. Create a seamless developer experience for Gemini users

## Key Adaptations Required
- Replace Claude Code integration with Gemini CLI integration
- Adapt agent communication patterns for Gemini's API
- Leverage Gemini's multimodal capabilities
- Integrate with Gemini's MCP server support
- Utilize Gemini's large context window (1M tokens)

## Development Approach
Following SPARC methodology:
- **S**pecification: Define clear requirements for each component
- **P**seudocode: Plan implementation logic
- **A**rchitecture: Design modular, extensible system
- **R**efinement: Iterate based on testing
- **C**ompletion: Deliver production-ready solution

## Technical Stack
- Node.js 18+
- TypeScript
- Gemini CLI API
- MCP Protocol support
- Cross-platform compatibility

## Current Status
- Project initialized: 2025-06-26
- Phase: Architecture and specification
